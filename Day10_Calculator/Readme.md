# 🧮 Calculator Program  

A Python project from **Day 10 of Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code** course.  
This program functions as a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations with continuous calculations until the user decides to exit.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Performs basic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**  
- Allows **chaining calculations** (use the previous result in the next calculation)  
- Uses **functions** for cleaner, modular code  
- Implements a **dictionary of operations** for flexibility  
- Handles invalid input gracefully

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  

---

## 📂 How It Works  
1. User inputs the **first number**.  
2. Program displays the available operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. User selects an operator and provides the **next number**.  
4. The calculation result is shown.  
5. User can choose to:  
   - Continue calculating with the current result, or  
   - Start a new calculation, or  
   - Exit the program.
